### Demo

- Live Site : https://clone-netflix-by-priya.netlify.app/

## My process

- I always start designing by following 4 steps:

   - First HTML Structure (start with header section).
   - Added CSS Designing. 
   - Added Media queries.
   - In Last JavaScript.

- After completing header section , move onto next section and , will follow same those above 4 steps.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Responsive Design 
- Vanilla JavaScript.
### What I learned

There were many things that I got in touch for the first time. Like:

- flex-box properties  
- Added Dark and Light mode- Improved user interface for better accessibility and readability
- Enhanced overall user experience- Floating links. 
- Form validation . It was a fun part until you know how to do it. Otherwise, it's really frustrating. I messed up many times while designing error messages but it was a good to go as I learned a lot.
